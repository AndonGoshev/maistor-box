## 🚧 Description

Maistor Box is a Django-based platform designed to connect users with **trusted contractors**. Whether you're planning a
renovation or construction project, finding the **right contractor** can be a challenge. **Maistor Box** aims to make
this process **easier** by providing access to contractors with genuine reviews, helping you make **informed decisions**.

## 🎯 Purpose

The idea behind **Maistor Box** stems from a simple question that we all ask at some point: "Do you know a good
contractor for ...?"
With Maistor Box, you can confidently find contractors who are trusted by others, ensuring quality service for your
renovation or construction needs.
